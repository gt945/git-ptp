GIT v1.6.1.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.1
------------------

* "git apply" took file modes from the patch text and updated the mode
  bits of the target tree even when the patch was not about mode changes.

* "git checkout $tree" did not trigger an error.

* "git describe --all" complained when a commit is described with a tag,
  which was nonsense.

* "git log --pretty=format:%s" did not handle a multi-line subject the
  same way as built-in log listers (i.e. shortlog, --pretty=oneline, etc.)

* "git daemon", and "git merge-file" are more careful when freopen fails
  and barf, instead of going on and writing to unopened filehandle.

* "git http-push" did not like some RFC 4918 compliant DAV server
  responses.

* "git merge -s recursive" mistakenly overwritten an untracked file in the
  work tree upon delete/modify conflict.

* "git merge -s recursive" didn't leave the index unmerged for entries with
  rename/delete conflictd.

* "git merge -s recursive" clobbered untracked files in the work tree.

* "git mv -k" with more than one errorneous paths misbehaved.

* "git rebase -i" issued an unnecessary error message upon a user error of
  marking the first commit to be "squash"ed.

Other documentation updates.
