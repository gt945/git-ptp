GIT v1.6.2.4 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.2.3
--------------------

* The configuration parser had a buffer overflow while parsing an overlong
  value.

* "git-checkout <tree-ish> <submodule>" did not update the index entry at
  the named path; it now does.

* "git init" segfaulted when given an overlong template location via
  the --template= option.

* "git-ls-tree" and "git-diff-tree" used a pathspec correctly when
  deciding to descend into a subdirectory but they did not match the
  individual paths correctly.  This caused pathspecs "abc/d ab" to match
  "abc/0" ("abc/d" made them decide to descend into the directory "abc/",
  and then "ab" incorrectly matched "abc/0" when it shouldn't).

* "git-merge-recursive" was broken when a submodule entry was involved in
  a criss-cross merge situation.

Many small documentation updates are included as well.
