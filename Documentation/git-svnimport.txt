git-svnimport - Import a SVN repository into git


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-svnimport' [ -o <branch-for-HEAD> ] [ -h ] [ -v ]
			[ -C <GIT_repository> ] [ -i ] [ -u ]
			[ -b branch_subdir ] [ -t trunk_subdir ] [ -T tag_subdir ]
			[ -s start_chg ] [ -m ] [ -M regex ] [ <SVN_repository_URL> ]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Imports a SVN repository into git. It will either create a new
repository, or incrementally import into an existing one.

SVN access is done by the SVN:: Perl module.

git-svnimport assumes that SVN repositories are organized into one
"trunk" directory where the main development happens, "branch/FOO"
directories for branches, and "/tags/FOO" directories for tags.
Other subdirectories are ignored.

git-svnimport creates a file ".git/svn2git", which is required for
incremental SVN imports. 

OPTIONS
-------
-C <target-dir>::
        The GIT repository to import to.  If the directory doesn't
        exist, it will be created.  Default is the current directory.

-s <start_rev>::
        Start importing at this SVN change number. The  default is 1.
+
When importing incementally, you might need to edit the .git/svn2git file.

-i::
	Import-only: don't perform a checkout after importing.  This option
	ensures the working directory and cache remain untouched and will
	not create them if they do not exist.

-t <trunk_subdir>::
	Name the SVN trunk. Default "trunk".
	
-T <tag_subdir>::
	Name the SVN subdirectory for tags. Default "tags".
	
-b <branch_subdir>::
	Name the SVN subdirectory for branches. Default "branches".
	
-o <branch-for-HEAD>::
	The 'trunk' branch from SVN is imported to the 'origin' branch within
	the git repository. Use this option if you want to import into a
	different branch.

-m::    
	Attempt to detect merges based on the commit message. This option
	will enable default regexes that try to capture the name source 
	branch name from the commit message. 

-M <regex>::
	Attempt to detect merges based on the commit message with a custom
	regex. It can be used with -m to also see the default regexes. 
	You must escape forward slashes. 

-v::
	Verbosity: let 'svnimport' report what it is doing.

<SVN_repository_URL>::
	The URL of the SVN module you want to import. For local
	repositories, use "file:///absolute/path".

-h::
	Print a short usage message and exit.

OUTPUT
------
If '-v' is specified, the script reports what it is doing.

Otherwise, success is indicated the Unix way, i.e. by simply exiting with
a zero exit status.
