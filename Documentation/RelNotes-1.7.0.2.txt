Git v1.7.0.2 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.0.1
--------------------

 * "git fast-import" didn't work with a large input, as it lacked support
   for producing the pack index in v2 format.

 * "git imap-send" didn't use CRLF line endings over the imap protocol
   when storing its payload to the draft box, violating RFC 3501.

 * Error messages generated on the receiving end did not come back to "git
   push".

And other minor fixes and documentation updates.
