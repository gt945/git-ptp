git-push(1)
===========

NAME
----
git-push - Update remote refs along with associated objects.


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-push' [--all] [--tags] [--force] <repository> <refspec>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects
necessary to complete the given refs.

You can make "interesting" things to happen on the repository
every time you push into it, by setting up 'hooks' there.  See
documentation for gitlink:git-receive-pack[1].


OPTIONS
-------
include::pull-fetch-param.txt[]

\--all::
	Instead of naming each ref to push, specifies all refs
	to be pushed.

\--tags::
	All refs under `$GIT_DIR/refs/tags` are pushed, in
	addition to refspecs explicitly listed on the command
	line.

-f, \--force::
	Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref that is
	not a descendent of the local ref used to overwrite it.
	This flag disables the check.  This can cause the
	remote repository to lose commits; use it with care.
