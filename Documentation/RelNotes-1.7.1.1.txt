Git v1.7.1.1 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Fixes since v1.7.1
------------------

 * Authentication over http transport can now be made lazily, in that the
   request can first go to a URL without username, get a 401 response and
   then the client will ask for the username to use.

 * We used to mistakenly think "../work" is a subdirectory of the current
   directory when we are in "../work-xyz".

 * The attribute mechanism now allows an entry that uses an attribute
   macro that set/unset one attribute, immediately followed by an
   overriding setting; this makes attribute macros much easier to use.

 * "git am -3" did not show diagnosis when the patch in the message was corrupt.

 * "git bundle --stdin" segfaulted.

 * "git describe" did not tie-break tags that point at the same commit
   correctly; newer ones are preferred by paying attention to the
   tagger date now.

 * "git fetch" over HTTP verifies the downloaded packfiles more robustly.

 * The memory usage by "git index-pack" (run during "git fetch" and "git
   push") got leaner.

 * "GIT_DIR=foo.git git init --bare bar.git" created foo.git instead of bar.git.

 * "git log --abbrev=$num --format='%h' ignored --abbrev=$num.

 * "git send-email" lacked a way to specify the domainname used in the
   EHLO/HELO exchange, causing rejected connection from picky servers.
   It learned --smtp-domain option to solve this issue.

 * "git stash" incorrectly lost paths in the working tree that were
   previously removed from the index.

 * "git status" stopped refreshing the index by mistake in 1.7.1.

 * "git status" showed excess "hints" even when advice.statusHints is set to false.

And other minor fixes and documentation updates.
