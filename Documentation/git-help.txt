git-help(1)
===========

NAME
----
git-help - display help information about git

SYNOPSIS
--------
'git help' [-a|--all|-i|--info|-w|--web] [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

With no options and no COMMAND given, the synopsis of the 'git'
command and a list of the most commonly used git commands are printed
on the standard output.

If the option '--all' or '-a' is given, then all available commands are
printed on the standard output.

If a git command is named, a manual page for that command is brought
up. The 'man' program is used by default for this purpose, but this
can be overriden by other options.

Note that 'git --help ...' is identical as 'git help ...' because the
former is internally converted into the latter.

OPTIONS
-------
-a|--all::
	Prints all the available commands on the standard output. This
	option superseeds any other option.

-i|--info::
	Use the 'info' program to display the manual page, instead of
	the 'man' program that is used by default.

-w|--web::
	Use a web browser to display the HTML manual page, instead of
	the 'man' program that is used by default.
+
The web browser can be specified using the configuration variable
'help.browser', or 'web.browser' if the former is not set. If none of
these config variables is set, the 'git-browse-help' script (called by
'git-help') will pick a suitable default.
+
You can explicitly provide a full path to your prefered browser by
setting the configuration variable 'browser.<tool>.path'. For example,
you can configure the absolute path to firefox by setting
'browser.firefox.path'. Otherwise, 'git-browse-help' assumes the tool
is available in PATH.
+
Note that the script tries, as much as possible, to display the HTML
page in a new tab on an already opened browser.
