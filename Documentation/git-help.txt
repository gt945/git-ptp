git-help(1)
======

NAME
----
git-help - display help information about git

SYNOPSIS
--------
'git help' [-a|--all|-i|--info] [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

With no options and no COMMAND given, the synopsis of the 'git'
command and a list of the most commonly used git commands are printed
on the standard output.

If the option '--all' or '-a' is given, then all available commands are
printed on the standard output.

If a git command is named, a manual page for that command is brought
up. The 'man' program is used by default for this purpose, but this
can be overriden by other options.

Note that 'git --help ...' is identical as 'git help ...' because the
former is internally converted into the latter.

OPTIONS
-------
-a|--all::

	Prints all the available commands on the standard output. This
	option superseeds any other option.

-i|--info::
	Use the 'info' program to display the manual page, instead of
	the 'man' program that is used by default.
