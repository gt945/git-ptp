NAME
----
git-update-server-info - Update auxiliary info file to help dumb servers


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-update-server-info' [--force]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A dumb server that does not do on-the-fly pack generations can
have some auxiliary information files in $GIT_DIR/info and
$GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY/info directories to help clients discover
what references and packs the server has and make optimized
pull decisions.  This command generates such auxiliary files.


OPTIONS
-------

--force::
	Update the info files from scratch.


OUTPUT
------

Currently the command updates the following files.  Please see
link:repository-layout.html[repository-layout] for description
of what they are for:

* objects/info/packs

* info/refs


BUGS
----
When you remove an existing ref, the command fails to update
info/refs file unless `--force` flag is given.
