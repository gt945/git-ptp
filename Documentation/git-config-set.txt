git-config-set(1)
===============

NAME
----
git-config-set - Set options in .git/config.


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-config-set' ( name [value [value_regex]] | --unset name [value_regex] )

DESCRIPTION
-----------
You can set/replace/unset options with this command. The name is actually
the section and the key separated by a dot, and the value will be escaped.

If you want to set/unset an option which can occor on multiple lines, you
should provide a POSIX regex for the value.

This command will fail if

. .git/config is invalid,
. .git/config can not be written to,
. no section was provided,
. the section or key is invalid,
. you try to unset an option which does not exist, or
. you try to unset/set an option for which multiple lines match.


OPTIONS
-------

--unset::
	Remove the given option from .git/config


EXAMPLE
-------

Given a .git/config like this:

	#
	# This is the config file, and
	# a '#' or ';' character indicates
	# a comment
	#

	; core variables
	[core]
		; Don't trust file modes
		filemode = false

	; Our diff algorithm
	[diff]
		external = "/usr/local/bin/gnu-diff -u"
		renames = true

	; Proxy settings
	[proxy]
		command="ssh" for "ssh://kernel.org/"
		command="proxy-command" for kernel.org
		command="myprotocol-command" for "my://"

you can set the filemode to true with

------------
% git config-set core.filemode true
------------

The hypothetic proxy command entries actually have a postfix to discern
to what URL they apply. Here is how to change the entry for kernel.org
to "ssh".

------------
% git config-set proxy.command '"ssh" for kernel.org' 'for kernel.org$'
------------

This makes sure that only the key/value pair for kernel.org is replaced.

To delete the entry for renames, do

------------
% git config-set --unset diff.renames
------------

or just

------------
% git config-set diff.renames
------------

If you want to delete an entry for a multivar (like proxy.command above),
you have to provide a regex matching the value of exactly one line.
