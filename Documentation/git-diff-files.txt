NAME

git-diff-files - Compares files in the working tree and the index


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-diff-files' [-q] [<common diff options>] [<path>...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Compares the files in the working tree and the index.  When paths
are specified, compares only those named paths.  Otherwise all
entries in the index are compared.  The output format is the
same as "git-diff-index" and "git-diff-tree".

OPTIONS
-------
include::diff-options.txt[]

-1 -2 -3 or --base --ours --theirs, and -0::
	Diff against the "base" version, "our branch" or "their
	branch" respectively.  With these options, diffs for
	merged entries are not shown.
+
The default is to diff against our branch (-2) if there
is an unmerged path, and show diff for unmerged entries
otherwise.  The option -0 can be given to force diff for
unmerged entries even when the index is unmerged.

-q::
	Remain silent even on nonexisting files

Output format
-------------
include::diff-format.txt[]
