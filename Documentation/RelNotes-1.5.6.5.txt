GIT v1.5.6.5 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.6.4
--------------------

* "git init --template=" with blank "template" parameter linked files
  under root directories to .git, which was a total nonsense.  Instead, it
  means "I do not want to use anything from the template directory".

* "git show-branch" mishandled its 8th branch.

* Addition of "git update-index --ignore-submodules" that happened during
  1.5.6 cycle broke "git update-index --ignore-missing".

* "git send-email" did not parse charset from an existing Content-type:
  header properly.

Contains other various documentation fixes.
