NAME
----
git-index-pack - Build pack index file for an existing packed archive


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-index-pack' [-o <index-file>] <pack-file>
'git-index-pack' --stdin [--fix-thin] [-o <index-file>] [<pack-file>]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Reads a packed archive (.pack) from the specified file, and
builds a pack index file (.idx) for it.  The packed archive
together with the pack index can then be placed in the
objects/pack/ directory of a git repository.


OPTIONS
-------
-o <index-file>::
	Write the generated pack index into the specified
	file.  Without this option the name of pack index
	file is constructed from the name of packed archive
	file by replacing .pack with .idx (and the program
	fails if the name of packed archive does not end
	with .pack).

--stdin::
	When this flag is provided, the pack is read from stdin
	instead and a copy is then written to <pack-file>. If
	<pack-file> is not specified, the pack is written to
	objects/pack/ directory of the current git repository with
	a default name determined from the pack content.

--fix-thin::
	It is possible for gitlink:git-pack-objects[1] to build
	"thin" pack, which records objects in deltified form based on
	objects not included in the pack to reduce network traffic.
	Those objects are expected to be present on the receiving end
	and they must be included in the pack for that pack to be self
	contained and indexable. Without this option any attempt to
	index a thin pack will fail. This option only makes sense in
	conjonction with --stdin.
