git-am(1)
================

NAME
----
git-am - Apply a series of patches in a mailbox


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-am' [--signoff] [--dotest=<dir>] [--utf8] [--3way] <mbox>
'git-am' [--skip]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Splits mail messages in a mailbox into commit log message,
authorship information and patches, and applies them to the
current branch.

This is the replacement for the 'git-applymbox' script.
Unlike git-applymbox, it can take more than one mailbox file from
the command line, as well as reading from the standard input when
'-' is specified. Other differences include changed parameter names
and less descriptive command name.


When initially invoking it, you give it name of the mailbox to crunch.
The usage hints that it might get interrupted and you will want to
resume the last round of applying - to do that, pass it no mailbox
name, and optionally the mysterious '--skip' parameter.
