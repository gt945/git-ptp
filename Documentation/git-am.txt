NAME
----
git-am - Apply a series of patches in a mailbox


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-am' [--signoff] [--dotest=<dir>] [--utf8] [--3way] <mbox>...
'git-am' [--skip]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Splits mail messages in a mailbox into commit log message,
authorship information and patches, and applies them to the
current branch.

OPTIONS
-------
--signoff::
	Add `Signed-off-by:` line to the commit message, using
	the committer identity of yourself.

--dotest=<dir>::
	Instead of `.dotest` directory, use <dir> as a working
	area to store extracted patches.

--utf8, --keep::
	Pass `--utf8` and `--keep` flags to `git-mailinfo` (see
	gitlink:git-mailinfo[1]).

--3way::
	When the patch does not apply cleanly, fall back on
	3-way merge, if the patch records the identity of blobs
	it is supposed to apply to, and we have those blobs
	locally.

--skip::
	Skip the current patch.  This is only meaningful when
	restarting an aborted patch.

--interactive::
	Run interactively, just like git-applymbox.


DISCUSSION
----------

When initially invoking it, you give it names of the mailboxes
to crunch.  Upon seeing the first patch that does not apply, it
aborts in the middle, just like 'git-applymbox' does.  You can
recover from this in one of two ways:

. skip the current one by re-running the command with '--skip'
  option.

. hand resolve the conflict in the working directory, run 'git
  diff HEAD' to extract the merge result into a patch form and
  replacing the patch in .dotest/patch file.  After doing this,
  run `git-reset --hard HEAD` to bring the working tree to the
  state before half-applying the patch, then re-run the command
  without any options.

The command refuses to process new mailboxes while `.dotest`
directory exists, so if you decide to start over from scratch,
run `rm -f .dotest` before running the command with mailbox
names.
