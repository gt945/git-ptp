git-unpack-objects(1)
=====================

NAME
----
git-unpack-objects - Unpack objects from a packed archive


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-unpack-objects' [-n] [-q] <pack-file


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Read a packed archive (.pack) from the standard input, expanding
the objects contained within and writing them into the repository in
"loose" (one object per file) format.

Objects that already exist in the repository will *not* be unpacked
from the pack-file.  Therefore, nothing will be unpacked if you use
this command on a pack-file that exists within the target repository.

Please see the `git-repack` documentation for options to generate
new packs and replace existing ones.

OPTIONS
-------
-n::
        Only list the objects that would be unpacked, don't actually unpack
        them.

-q::
	The command usually shows percentage progress.  This
	flag suppresses it.
