git-repack(1)
=============
v0.99.5, August 2005

NAME
----
git-repack - Script used to pack a repository from a collection of
objects into pack files.


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-repack' [-a] [-d]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This script is used to combine all objects that do not currently
reside in a "pack", into a pack.

A pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with
delta compression applied, stored in a single file, with an
associated index file.

Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup
engines, disk storage, etc.

OPTIONS
-------

-a::
	Instead of incrementally packing the unpacked objects,
	pack everything available into a single pack.
	Especially useful when packing a repository that is used
	for a private development and there no need to worry
	about people fetching via dumb protocols from it.  Use
	with '-d'.

-d::
	After packing, if the newly created packs make some
	existing packs redundant, remove the redundant packs.
