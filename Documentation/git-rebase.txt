git-rebase(1)
=============

NAME
----
git-rebase - Rebase local commits to new upstream head

SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-rebase' [--onto <newbase>] <upstream> [<branch>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
git-rebase applies to <upstream> (or optionally to <newbase>) commits
from <branch> that do not appear in <upstream>. When <branch> is not
specified it defaults to the current branch (HEAD).

When git-rebase is complete, <branch> will be updated to point to the
newly created line of commit objects, so the previous line will not be
accessible unless there are other references to it already.

Assume the following history exists and the current branch is "topic":

          A---B---C topic
         /
    D---E---F---G master

From this point, the result of the following commands:

    git-rebase master
    git-rebase master topic

would be:

                  A'--B'--C' topic
                 /
    D---E---F---G master

While, starting from the same point, the result of the following
commands:

    git-rebase --onto master~1 master
    git-rebase --onto master~1 master topic

would be:

              A'--B'--C' topic
             /
    D---E---F---G master

OPTIONS
-------
<newbase>::
	Starting point at which to create the new commits. If the
	--onto option is not specified, the starting point is
	<upstream>.

<upstream>::
	Upstream branch to compare against.

<head>::
	Working branch; defaults to HEAD.
