GIT v1.5.3.5 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.3.4
--------------------

 * "git-config" silently ignored options after --list; now it will
   error out with a usage message.

 * "git-config --file" failed if the argument used a relative path
   as it changed directories before opening the file.

 * "git-config --file" now displays a proper error message if it
   cannot read the file specified on the command line.

 * "git-config", "git-diff", "git-apply" failed if run from a
   subdirectory with relative GIT_DIR and GIT_WORK_TREE set.

 * "git-blame" crashed if run during a merge conflict.

 * "git-add -i" did not handle single line hunks correctly.

 * "git-rebase -i" and "git-stash apply" failed if external diff
   drivers were used for one or more files in a commit.  They now
   avoid calling the external diff drivers.

 * "git-log --follow" did not work unless diff generation (e.g. -p)
   was also requested.

 * "git-log" printed extra newlines between commits when a diff
   was generated internally (e.g. -S or --follow) but not displayed.

 * "git-push" error message is more helpful when pushing to a
   repository with no matching refs and none specified.

 * "git-filter-branch" now updates the working directory when it
   has finished filtering the current branch.

 * "git-instaweb" no longer fails on Mac OS X.

 * "git-cvsexportcommit" didn't always create new parent directories
   before trying to create new child directories.  Fixed.

 * "git-fetch" printed a scary (but bogus) error message while
   fetching a tag that pointed to a tree or blob.  The error did
   not impact correctness, only user perception.  The bogus error
   is no longer printed.

 * Git segfaulted when reading an invalid .gitattributes file.  Fixed.

 * post-receive-email example hook fixed was fixed for
   non-fast-forward updates.

 * Documentation updates for supported (but previously undocumented)
   options of "git-archive" and "git-reflog".

 * "make clean" no longer deletes the configure script that ships
   with the git tarball, making multiple architecture builds easier.
