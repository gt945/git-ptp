=============

NAME
----
git-mktree - Build a tree-object from ls-tree formatted text


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git mktree' [-z] [--missing]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Reads standard input in non-recursive `ls-tree` output format, and creates
a tree object.  The order of the tree entries is normalised by mktree so
pre-sorting the input is not required.  The object name of the tree object
built is written to the standard output.

OPTIONS
-------
-z::
	Read the NUL-terminated `ls-tree -z` output instead.

--missing::
	Allow missing objects.  The default behaviour (without this option)
	is to verify that each tree entry's sha1 identifies an existing
	object.  This option has no effect on the treatment of gitlink entries
	(aka "submodules") which are always allowed to be missing.
