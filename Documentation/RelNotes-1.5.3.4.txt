GIT v1.5.3.4 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.3.3
--------------------

 * Sample 'post-receive-hook' incorrectly sent out push
   notification e-mails marked as "From: " the committer of the
   commit that happened to be at the tip of the branch that was
   pushed, not from the person who pushed.

 * git-remote did not exit non-zero status upon error.

 * "git-add -i" did not respond very well to EOF from tty nor
   bogus input.

 * "git rebase -i" squash subcommand incorrectly made the
   author of later commit the author of resulting commit,
   instead of taking from the first one in the squashed series.

 * "git stash apply --index" was not documented.
