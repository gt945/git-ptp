NAME
----
git-merge - Grand Unified Merge Driver


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-merge' [-n] [-s <strategy>]... <msg> <head> <remote> <remote>...


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is the top-level user interface to the merge machinery
which drives multiple merge strategy scripts.


OPTIONS
-------
-n::
	Do not show diffstat at the end of the merge.

-s <strategy>::
	use that merge strategy; can be given more than once to
	specify them in the order they should be tried.  If
	there is no `-s` option, built-in list of strategies is
	used instead.

<head>::
	our branch head commit.

<remote>::
	other branch head merged into our branch.  You need at
	least one <remote>.  Specifying more than one <remote>
	obviously means you are trying an Octopus.
