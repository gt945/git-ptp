git-merge(1)
============

NAME
----
git-merge - Grand Unified Merge Driver


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-merge' [-n] [--no-commit] [-s <strategy>]... <msg> <head> <remote> <remote>...


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is the top-level user interface to the merge machinery
which drives multiple merge strategy scripts.


OPTIONS
-------
include::merge-pull-opts.txt[]

<msg>::
	The commit message to be used for the merge commit (in case
	it is created). The `git-fmt-merge-msg` script can be used
	to give a good default for automated `git-merge` invocations.

<head>::
	our branch head commit.

<remote>::
	other branch head merged into our branch.  You need at
	least one <remote>.  Specifying more than one <remote>
	obviously means you are trying an Octopus.
