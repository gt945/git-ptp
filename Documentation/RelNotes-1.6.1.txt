GIT v1.6.1 Release Notes
========================

Updates since v1.6.0
--------------------

When some commands (e.g. "git log", "git diff") spawn pager internally, we
used to make the pager the parent process of the git command that produces
output.  This meant that the exit status of the whole thing comes from the
pager, not the underlying git command.  We swapped the order of the
processes around and you will see the exit code from the command from now
on.

(subsystems)

(portability)

(documentation)

* ...

(performance)

* The underlying diff machinery to produce textual output has been
  optimized, which would result in faster "git blame" processing.

(usability, bells and whistles)

* "git checkout --track origin/hack" used to be a syntax error.  It now
  DWIMs to create a corresponding local branch "hack", i.e. acts as if you
  said "git checkout --track -b hack origin/hack".

* "git diff" learned to mimick --suppress-blank-empty from GNU diff via a
  configuration option.

* "git imap-send" can optionally talk SSL.

(internal)

* "git hash-object" learned to lie about the path being hashed, so that
  correct gitattributes processing can be done while hashing contents
  stored in a temporary file.

Fixes since v1.6.0

All of the fixes in v1.6.0.X maintenance series are included in this
