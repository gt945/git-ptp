GIT v1.5.6.2 Release Notes
==========================

Futureproof
-----------

 * "git-shell" accepts requests without a dash between "git" and
   subcommand name (e.g. "git upload-pack") which the newer client will
   start to make sometime in the future.

Fixes since v1.5.6.1
--------------------

* Optimization for a large import via "git-svn" introduced in v1.5.6 had a
  serious memory and temporary file leak, which made it unusable for
  moderately large import.

* "git-svn" mangled remote nickname used in the configuration file
  unnecessarily.

* "git diff --check" did not report the result via its exit status
  reliably.

* "git show" segfaulted when an annotated tag that points at another
  annotated tag was given to it.
