=============

NAME
----
git-bisect - Find the change that introduced a bug


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git bisect' start
'git bisect' bad <rev>
'git bisect' good <rev>
'git bisect' reset [<branch>]
'git bisect' visualize


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command uses 'git-rev-list --bisect' option to help drive
the binary search process to find which change introduced a bug,
given an old "good" commit object name and a later "bad" commit
object name.

The way you use it is:

------------------------------------------------
git bisect start
git bisect bad			# Current version is bad
git bisect good v2.6.13-rc2	# v2.6.13-rc2 was the last version
				# tested that was good
------------------------------------------------

When you give at least one bad and one good versions, it will
bisect the revision tree and say something like:

------------------------------------------------
Bisecting: 675 revisions left to test after this
------------------------------------------------

and check out the state in the middle. Now, compile that kernel, and boot
it. Now, let's say that this booted kernel works fine, then just do

------------------------------------------------
git bisect good			# this one is good
------------------------------------------------

which will now say

------------------------------------------------
Bisecting: 337 revisions left to test after this
------------------------------------------------

and you continue along, compiling that one, testing it, and depending on
whether it is good or bad, you say "git bisect good" or "git bisect bad",
and ask for the next bisection.

Until you have no more left, and you'll have been left with the first bad
kernel rev in "refs/bisect/bad".

Oh, and then after you want to reset to the original head, do a

------------------------------------------------
git bisect reset
------------------------------------------------

to get back to the master branch, instead of being in one of the bisection
branches ("git bisect start" will do that for you too, actually: it will
reset the bisection state, and before it does that it checks that you're
not using some old bisection branch).

During the bisection process, you can say

	git bisect visualize

to see the currently remaining suspects in `gitk`.
