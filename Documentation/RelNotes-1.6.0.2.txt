GIT v1.6.0.2 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.0.1
--------------------

* Installation on platforms that needs .exe suffix to git-* programs were
  broken in 1.6.0.1.

* Installation on filesystems without symbolic links support did nto
  work well.

* In-tree documentations and test scripts now use "git foo" form to set a
  better example, instead of the "git-foo" form (which is an acceptable
  form if you have "PATH=$(git --exec-path):$PATH" in your script)

* Many commands did not use the correct working tree location when used
  with GIT_WORK_TREE environment settings.



* "git apply --unidiff-zero" incorrectly applied a -U0 patch that inserts
  a new line before the second line.

* "git clone $there $here/" with extra trailing slashes after explicit
  local directory name $here did not work as expected.

* "git diff --dirstat -M" did not add changes in subdirectories up
  correctly for renamed paths.

* "git for-each-ref refs/heads/" did not work as expected.

* "git log --grep=pattern -i" did not ignore case.

* "git log --pretty="%ad" --date=short" did not use short format when
  showing the timestamp.

* Build procedure for "git shell" that used stub versions of some
  functions and globals was not understood by linkers on some platforms.

* "git verify-pack -v" did not work correctly when given more than one
  packfile.

Also contains many documentation updates.
