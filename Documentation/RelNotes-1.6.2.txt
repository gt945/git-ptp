GIT v1.6.2 Release Notes
========================

Updates since v1.6.1
--------------------

(subsystems)

(portability)

(performance)

* pack-objects autodetects the number of CPUs available and uses threaded
  version.

(usability, bells and whistles)

* "git-add -p" learned 'g'oto action to jump directly to a hunk.

* git-cherry defaults to HEAD when the <upstream> argument is not given.

* git-cvsserver can be told not to add extra "via git-CVS emulator" to the
  commit log message it serves via gitcvs.commitmsgannotation configuration.

* git-diff learned a new option --inter-hunk-context to coalesce close
  hunks together and show context between them.

* git-filter-branch learned --prune-empty option that discards commits
  that do not change the contents.

* git-ls-tree learned --full-tree option that shows the path in full
  regardless of where in the work tree hierarchy the command was started.

* git-mergetool learned -y(--no-prompt) option to disable prompting.

* "git-reset --merge" is a new mode that works similar to the way
  "git checkout" switches branches, taking the local changes while
  switching to another commit.

(internal)


Fixes since v1.6.1
------------------

All of the fixes in v1.6.1.X maintenance series are included in this
release, unless otherwise noted.

* "git-add sub/file" when sub is a submodule incorrectly added the path to
  the superproject.

* git-bundle did not exclude annotated tags even when a range given from the
  command line wanted to.

* git-grep did not work correctly for index entries with assume-unchanged bit.

* branch switching and merges had a silly bug that did not validate
  the correct directory when making sure an existing subdirectory is
  clean.
