git-write-tree(1)
=================

NAME
----
git-write-tree - Creates a tree object from the current cache


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-write-tree' [--missing-ok]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Creates a tree object using the current cache.

The cache must be merged.

Conceptually, "git-write-tree" sync()s the current directory cache contents
into a set of tree files.
In order to have that match what is actually in your directory right
now, you need to have done a "git-update-index" phase before you did the
"git-write-tree".

OPTIONS
-------
--missing-ok::
	Normally "git-write-tree" ensures that the objects referenced by the
	directory exist in the object database.  This option disables this check.
