GIT v1.6.0.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.0.2
--------------------

* "git archive --format=zip" did not honor core.autocrlf while
  --format=tar did.

* Continuing "git rebase -i" was very confused when the user left modified
  files in the working tree while resolving conflicts.

* Continuing "git rebase -i" was also very confused when the user left
  some staged changes in the index after "edit".

* Behaviour of "git diff --quiet" was inconsistent with "diff --exit-code"
  with the output redirected to /dev/null.

* "git stash apply sash@{1}" was fixed to error out.  Prior versions
  would have applied stash@{0} incorrectly.

* "git for-each-ref --format=%(subject)" fixed for commits with no
  no newline in the message body.

* "git remote" fixed to protect printf from user input.

* "git checkout -q" once again suppresses the locally modified file list.

* Cross-directory renames are no longer used when creating packs.  This
  allows more graceful behavior on filesystems like sshfs.

* Stale temporary files under $GIT_DIR/objects/pack are now cleaned up
  automatically by "git prune".

* "Git.pm" tests relied on unnecessarily more recent version of Perl.

* "gitweb" triggered undef warning on commits without log messages.

Many other documentation updates.
