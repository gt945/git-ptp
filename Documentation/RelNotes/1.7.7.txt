Git v1.7.7 Release Notes
========================

Updates since v1.7.6
--------------------

 * The scripting part of the codebase is getting prepared for i18n/l10n.

 * Interix, Cygwin and Minix ports got updated.

 * A handful of patches to update git-p4 (in contrib/).

 * Gitweb learned to read from /etc/gitweb-common.conf when it exists,
   before reading from gitweb_config.perl or from /etc/gitweb.conf
   (this last one is read only when per-repository gitweb_config.perl
   does not exist).

 * Various codepaths that invoked zlib deflate/inflate assumed that these
   functions can compress or uncompress more than 4GB data in one call on
   platforms with 64-bit long, which has been corrected.

 * "git archive" can be told to pass the output to gzip compression and
   produce "archive.tar.gz".

 * "git checkout" (both the code to update the files upon checking out a
   different branch, the code to checkout specific set of files) learned
   to stream the data from object store when possible, without having to
   read the entire contents of a file in memory first. An earlier round
   of this code that is not in any released version had a large leak but
   now it has been plugged.

 * "git clone" can now take "--config key=value" option to set the
   repository configuration options that affect the initial checkout.

 * "git commit <paths>..." now lets you feed relative pathspecs that
   refer outside your current subdirectory.

 * "git diff --stat" learned --stat-count option to limit the output of
   diffstat report.

 * "git fetch", "git push" and friends no longer show connection
   errors for addresses that couldn't be connected when at least one
   address succeeds (this is arguably a regression but a deliberate
   one).

 * "git grep" learned --break and --heading options, to let users mimic
   output format of "ack".

 * "git grep" learned "-W" option that shows wider context using the same
   logic used by "git diff" to determine the hunk header.

 * "git rebase master topci" no longer spews usage hints after giving
   "fatal: no such branch: topci" error message.

 * "git stash" learned --include-untracked option.

 * "git submodule update" used to stop at the first error updating a
   submodule; it now goes on to update other submodules that can be
   updated, and reports the ones with errors at the end.

 * "git verify-pack" has been rewritten to use the "index-pack" machinery
   that is more efficient in reading objects in packfiles.

 * test scripts for gitweb tried to run even when CGI-related perl modules
   are not installed; it now exits early when they are unavailable.

Also contains various documentation updates and minor miscellaneous
changes.


Fixes since v1.7.6
------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes in 1.7.6.X maintenance track are
included in this release.

 * "git checkout -b <branch>" sometimes wrote a bogus reflog entry,
   causing later "git checkout -" fail.
   (merge 71ee7fd jc/checkout-reflog-fix~1 later).

 * "git diff --cc" learned to correctly ignore binary files.
   (merge 0508fe5 jk/combine-diff-binary-etc later)

 * "git fast-export" forgot to quote pathnames with unsafe characters
   in its output.
   (merge 6280dfd jk/fast-export-quote-path later)

 * "git fetch" did not recurse into submodules in subdirectories.
   (merge ea2d325 jl/maint-fetch-recursive-fix later)

 * "git ls-tree" did not error out when asked to show a corrupt tree.
   (merge 04f8925 js/ls-tree-error later)

 * "git pull" without any argument left an extra whitespace after the
   command name in its reflog.
   (merge c98d1e4 oa/pull-reflog later)

 * "git rebase -i -p" incorrectly dropped commits from side branches.
   (merge 12bf828 aw/rebase-i-p later)

 * "git reset [<commit>] paths..." did not reset the index entry correctly
   for unmerged paths.
   (merge ff00b682 jc/maint-reset-unmerged-path later)

 * "git submodule add" did not allow a relative repository path when
   the superproject did not have any default remote url.
   (merge f22a17e8 jl/submodule-add-relurl-wo-upstream later)

 * "git submodule foreach" failed to correctly give the standard input to
   the user-supplied command it invoked.
   (merge 4dca1aa bc/submodule-foreach-stdin-fix-1.7.4 later)

 * "git submodule update --quiet" was not really quiet.
   (merge 7e60407 jl/submodule-update-quiet later)

 * submodules that the user has never showed interest in by running
   "git submodule init" was incorrectly marked as interesting by "git
   submodule sync".
   (merge 2cd9de3 jc/submodule-sync-no-auto-vivify later)

 * "git tag -l <glob>..." did not take multiple glob patterns from the
   command line.
   (merge 588d0e8 jk/tag-list-multiple-patterns later)
