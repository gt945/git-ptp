Git v1.7.9 Release Notes (draft)
========================

Updates since v1.7.8
--------------------

 * Porcelain commands like "git reset" did not distinguish deletions
   and type-changes from ordinary modification, and reported them with
   the same 'M' moniker. They now use 'D' (for deletion) and 'T' (for
   type-change) to match "git status -s" and "git diff --name-status".

 * fsck and prune are relatively lengthy operations that still go
   silent while making the end-user wait. They learned to give progress
   output like other slow operations.

 * The set of built-in function-header patterns for various languages
   knows MATLAB.

May also contain documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.7.8
------------------

 * In some codepaths (notably, checkout and merge), the ignore patterns
   recorded in $GIT_DIR/info/exclude were not honored. They now are.
   (merge fc001b5 nd/maint-ignore-exclude later to maint).
