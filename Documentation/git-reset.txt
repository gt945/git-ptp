git-reset(1)
============

NAME
----
git-reset - Reset current HEAD to the specified state.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-reset' [--mixed | --soft | --hard] [<commit-ish>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Sets the current head to the specified commit and optionally resets the
index and working tree to match.

This command is useful if you notice some small error in a recent
commit (or set of commits) and want to redo that part without showing
the undo in the history.

If you want to undo a commit other than the latest on a branch,
gitlink:git-revert[1] is your friend.

OPTIONS
-------
--mixed::
	Resets the index but not the working tree (ie, the changed files
	are preserved but not marked for commit) and reports what has not
	been updated. This is the default action.

--soft::
	Does not touch the index file nor the working tree at all, but
	requires them to be in a good order. This leaves all your changed
	files "Updated but not checked in", as gitlink:git-status[1] would
	put it.

--hard::
	Matches the working tree and index to that of the tree being
	switched to. Any changes to tracked files in the working tree
	since <commit-ish> are lost.

<commit-ish>::
	Commit to make the current HEAD.
