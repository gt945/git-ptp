git-whatchanged(1)
==================

NAME
----
git-whatchanged - Show logs with difference each commit introduces.


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git whatchanged' <option>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows commit logs and diff output each commit introduces.  The
command internally invokes 'git-rev-list' piped to
'git-diff-tree', and takes command line options for both of
these commands.

This manual page describes only the most frequently used options.


OPTIONS
-------
-p::
	Show textual diffs, instead of the git internal diff
	output format that is useful only to tell the changed
	paths and their nature of changes.

--max-count=<n>::
	Limit output to <n> commits.

<since>..<until>::
	Limit output to between the two named commits (bottom
	exclusive, top inclusive).

-r::
	Show git internal diff output, but for the whole tree,
	not just the top level.

--pretty=<format>::
	Controls the output format for the commit logs.
	<format> can be one of 'raw', 'medium', 'short', 'full',
	and 'oneline'.
