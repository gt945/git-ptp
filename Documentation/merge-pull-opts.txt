-n, --no-summary::
	Do not show diffstat at the end of the merge.

--no-commit::
	Perform the merge but pretend the merge failed and do
	not autocommit, to give the user a chance to inspect and
	further tweak the merge result before committing.

-s <strategy>::
	use that merge strategy; can be given more than once to
	specify them in the order they should be tried.  If
	there is no `-s` option, built-in list of strategies is
	used instead (`git-merge-resolve` when merging a single
	head, `git-merge-octopus` otherwise).
